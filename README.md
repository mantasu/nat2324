Hi,

Before the final version is released, I'd like to clarify some things as the preliminary version in some aspects seems a bit abstract. I am tempted to do a lot of experimentation but perhaps that will not be taken into account when assessing.

General:
* Can we use a package-like structure instead of a single notebook? I mean if the zipped folder could include multiple python (utility) files, notebooks, `README` file etc?
* Where should we include running the code instructions: report appendix or code (e.g., notebook cells, `README.md`)?

Problem 1:
* Are we required to experiment with different population-based algorithms and justify our choice?
* Should we experiment with different non-trivial functions? Or can we stick with Rastrigin function (without worrying about losing marks)?

Problem 2:
* The numbers can only be integers?
* Should we account for unsolvable cases, i.e., when there is no valid combination of deletions?
* Are there any particular GA variations we should consider for a better mark? Or experimenting with different crossover/mutation strategies will suffice?

Problem 3:
* Should we experiment with different series and explain how the algorithm behaves differently for each?
* Should we experiment with variations of GP algorithms (and mutations/crossovers)?
* In question `c`, I am not sure how to approach generality, does the question ask us to explain how our implemented algorithm and selected terminals/non-terminals would extend to other series (and only series)? In particular, how should we test the generality?
